<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.PNG)

In this project I created a portfolio website using React.

You can see the demo [here](https://bozgen.github.io/portfolio)

The challenging parts of this project were:

- Creating a filter feature from scratch for the projects section.
- Displaying the projects page by page, 3 at a time.
- Alignment (CSS Grid)


The things that I have learned/improved while working with this project are:

- (CSS) Alignment by CSS-grid
- (React) Component lifecycles
- (React) Memoizing the components to optimize performance
- (React) Dealing with the es-lint dependency array warnings by using useCallback hook
- What was your experience?

It was a really fun project to make and it only took about a 2 days to finish up.

The fact that the design was already provided really helps focusing on the technical side of the project. Now, I surely feel a lot more confident about front-end development using React framework.


### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)


## Features
<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->
Some of the major features this website has:

- Navigate through the page using the header navigation bar.
- Display skills, experiences and hobbies dynamically and categorized since the related components are reusable. e.g. Front-end skills , back-end skills, education experiences, work experience and so on.
- Display blogs.
- Display your projects and tag them so that the projects can be filtered.
- Redirect to project codes or demos easily.



This website was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
